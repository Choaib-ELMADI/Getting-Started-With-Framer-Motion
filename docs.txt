1. Install framer motion
2. Import motion from framer motion
3. Make the element you want to animate, a motion element

4. Add animate prop (animate to)
    Add initial attribute (animate from)
    Add transition attribute

5. Add whileHover attribute to animate when hovering

6. Variants:
    Create an initial state and the state to animate to (You can add transition inside them)
    Pass the variants you created to variants attribute
    Add the initial and animate names

    ==> attributes propagate to children motion elements, but not inheriting the parent values

    ==> when attribute tells the parent to excute the childrens animations after he completed mounting

    ==> staggerChildren allows to add delay between childrens

7. Keyframes:
    Add an array of values to the property you want to animate
    or add one value and also add repeat (yoyo) property to the transition object

8. Animate presence:
    We use it to animate something out of the page
    Add the motion element and the exit attribute

9. useCycle Hook:
    toggle between variants animations

X. SVG: scalable vector graphics:
    viewport: defined by the width and the height of the svg.
    viewBox: defines the viewable area of the viewport (where the viewport is starting)

        circle:
            => r: radius
            => c: center => cx and cy
            => fill, stroke, strokeWidth...

        rect:
            => x: offset left
            => y: offset top
            => fill, stroke, strokeWidth...

        line:
            => x1 and y1: starting point
            => x2 and y2: ending point
            => stroke, strokeWidth...

        polygon:
            => points: x and y for each point
